<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<p>Lilly & Jerry Day Care was founded in 2017 (NPO NO. 187-743) with a deep love for children and a passion for early childhood development. With years of combined experience,
   our founders and staff are committed to creating a safe, engaging, and nurturing environment for every child. Our approach blends learning through play, 
   structured curriculum, and hands-on exploration - ensuring that each child thrives emotionally, intellectually, and socially. We are more than a 
   daycare - we are a community of caregivers, educators, and families working together to provide children with the best possible start in life.
   Every day, we create opportunities for growth, joy, and discovery, knowing that the early years shape who children will become.
</p>
<P>Every day at our daycare is filled with joyful moments - children painting with focus, laughing together during storytime, or exploring the world
   around them through outdoor play. These experiences not only support their learning but help them build friendships, confidence, and curiosity.

<p>We believe in being actively present with the children. Our supervisor and caregivers are not just watching - they're involved in the activities, 
   guiding play, supporting emotions, and sharing in each child's small but meaningful victories.
